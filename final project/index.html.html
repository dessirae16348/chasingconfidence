  <h3>SUCCESS STORIES</h3>
  <h4>Natasha Wessler</h4>
  <p class="w3-large">
    Natasha Wessler struggled with having bad acne all throughout most of her life. She heard people say things like “how can someone love a person with acne” or “you just need to wash your face and it will be gone.” In college she met a girl with the same name as her and when they became friends she told her that she had been referring to her as “the Ugly Natasha.” Hearing these things obviously had a negative impact on her self esteem. One day Natasha came across an instagram page of a girl who posted confidently with her acne. Seeing that page inspired her to not feel so ashamed of her acne. She decided she wanted to be happy and not worry so much about her acne, and even though it was hard, she did it.

  <h4> Ashley Graham</h4>
  <p class="w3-large">
    Ashley Graham is a American plus size model who celebrates body positivity and self love. She wasn’t always very confident in her body; she began modeling at age twelve and moved to New York at seventeen. She struggled not fitting the average model body, and at one point even was thinking of giving up, claiming “There was a moment when I was 18 years old and I said: ‘I can’t do this anymore’,”. But she persevered, gaining national attention and leading the way for other curvy women alike while spreading body positivity. She did this by creating a mantra for herself “You are fine, you are brilliant, and you are beautiful and bold.”. This was difficult to do. Everyone was telling her how she needs to change, even her own father. But she learned to believe in herself and gain self love.

  <h4> Alexa Wilson</h4>
  <p class="w3-large" >
    Alexa Wison dealt with low self esteem, ever since middle school. Before she didn’t understand why, she didn’t even realise it was low self esteem. She found value and self-worth from external sources. And this worked for her until she was alone, which lead her to surround herself with people continuously. It wasn’t until she was twenty-three years old contemplating graduate school. But she was afraid of going, afraid of not being smart enough, of it being too hard and failing. And it clicked in her she realized that in her life she passed on many opportunities because of her self doubt saying “Somehow, that [signing up for graduate school] got me thinking about all the things I didn’t do in life because I was afraid. Because I didn’t think I was smart enough, or pretty enough, or talented enough, or good enough, or whatever.”.  She realized that all of lacking self confidence came from elementary school. Learning the source of her problems allowed her to face them and re-teach herself how to be confident. She created a mantra of her own “I started telling myself that I was strong, confident, capable, and beautiful. I would say this to myself each night before I went to sleep.”. This created a cycle of her loving and believing in herself more than ever.
